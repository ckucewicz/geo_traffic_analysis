# 1. Project Overview

# 2. Research Question(s)
 - Which neighborhoods have the highest rate of severe crashes per capita?
 - Are majority Black and Latino neighborhoods disproportionately affected?
 - How does road design influence crash severity or frequency?
 	- Do wider roads experience higher rates of severe crashes?
	- Are Chicago's high speed arterials over-represented in fatal and serious injury crashes compared to their share of total road mileage?
 	- How does the severity of crashes vary by posted speed limit, particularly on streets with the default 30 miles per hour (mph)?
